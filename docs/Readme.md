It looks like you’ll need to **log in to ChatGPT** to use the Canvas feature (which allows me to create an actual document file for you).

In the meantime, I can still **draft your ecommerce document** right here.
Just tell me what kind of ecommerce doc you want:

### What kind of document should it be?

Examples:

* **Ecommerce Business Plan**
* **Ecommerce Product Requirements Document (PRD)**
* **Ecommerce Marketing Strategy**
* **Ecommerce Website Specification**
* **Ecommerce Operations SOP**
* **General overview / guide**

Tell me which one you want (or describe your goal), and I’ll create the full document.
```json
{
    "name": "Ecommerce Business Plan",
    "description": "Ecommerce Business Plan"
}
```
